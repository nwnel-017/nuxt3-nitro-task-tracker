# My Task App

Welcome to my task tracker app! This is an app I built while getting used to Vue.js with Nuxt 3 and Nitro! It is a simple app that lets you view and add tasks. I have been loving the simplicity with Nuxt 3 and Nitro, and will be using these frameworks for more projects soon!

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
yarn dev

# bun
bun run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build

# pnpm
pnpm build

# yarn
yarn build

# bun
bun run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview

# pnpm
pnpm preview

yarn preview

# bun
bun run preview
```
